## Project Description

In the Realm of Elements, a magical world full of enchantment, the five elements - Water, Wood, Fire, Metal, and Earth - coexist in harmony. However, the fragile balance of this world is threatened by a dark and mysterious force known as the Mystic Shadow.

To restore harmony and light in the Realm of Elements, our heroes - Aqua, Sylvanus, Ignis, Aurum, and Terra - embark on a daring adventure to confront the Mystic Shadow and bring back light and balance.
